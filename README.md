# CppContainerChecker

## Overview
CppContainerChecker is a C++ utility designed to provide a set of general-purpose functions that enable checking whether any, all, or none of the specified arguments are present in a given container. This repository contains template functions that can be used to easily verify the presence of elements in containers such as vectors, arrays, and lists.

## Features
- **General-Purpose**: Works with any standard container that supports iterators.
- **Variadic Template Functions**: Accepts any number of arguments to be checked against the container.
- **Efficient Searching**: Utilizes `std::find` to perform searches within containers.

## Functions
- `contains_any`: Checks if any of the specified elements are present in the container.
- `contains_all`: Verifies that all specified elements exist in the container.
- `contains_none`: Ensures that none of the specified elements are present in the container.
